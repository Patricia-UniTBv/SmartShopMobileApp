Smart Shop - Mobile App for purchasing directly from the supermarket using Barcode scanning

With the goal of simplifying shopping and reducing time spent in supermarkets, the SmartShop app offers an intuitive and user-friendly design, along with numerous useful features for Android users.

Thanks to the scan-and-pay feature directly within the app, this technological solution can eliminate queues at checkout counters or self-service kiosks, transforming the shopping experience into a more pleasant and smooth process.

Initially, customers can create an account in the app or log in if they are already registered, using their email and password. They can also log out and switch to a different account.

Customers can select the supermarket they are in by using the map that displays all supermarkets in Bra»ôov, and after this step, they can start scanning the barcodes of the products they want to purchase using their phone's camera. The products are added to a virtual shopping cart, where more items can be added, or existing items can be removed if the customer no longer wishes to purchase them.

The payment process is securely managed through the Stripe platform, ensuring that each transaction is safe and protected. This allows every shopper to fully trust that their card details are secure and that each transaction is handled responsibly. After purchasing products, the user receives a payment confirmation email if the transaction is successful.

Additionally, the user can view the history of their shopping carts, along with the dates of the purchases, the products bought, and the amounts spent. This data can be filtered by various criteria, such as price, time period, or supermarket. Furthermore, there is a statistics page available for better money management, providing a clear overview of expenses during specific periods, as well as spending by product category.

The user can also view current offers for products from different supermarkets and the validity period of these offers. On the profile page, the user can customize the app to suit their preferences, making the shopping process easier. 
For example, the user can choose to display the app's text in their preferred language, with three options available: Romanian, English, and French. Moreover, they can choose to display prices in a different currency, with conversions being made at the current exchange rate. The conversion can be done in euros, lei, dollars, or pounds, depending on the user's preference.
The preferred language and currency are saved so that they remain unchanged for future sessions.

After completing their shopping, the customer will receive a unique QR code that can be scanned upon exiting the store.
